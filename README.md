# My portfolio
## Project 8 Openclassrooms : a simple web site where I expose all my projects learned when training.
## Installation
Clone the GitHub repository : `git clone https://github.com/LeChat76/Projet8OC.git`  
Go to the created folder : `cd Projet8OC`  
Create virtual environment : `python -m venv .venv`
- activate environment :
    * for Linux `source .venv/bin/activate`
    * for Windows `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
Install all needed libraries by typing : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
## Execution
Simply launch `py .\main.py` and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` from your favorite web browser.
If online, you can access to this web site directly from internet : `https://lechat76-portfolio.onrender.com/`.
## Notes
This web site is hosted in Render (https://render.com/). Each time I push new modifications on the GitHub repository, I have to deploy this latested commit on Render (no auto deploy because sometime I update only few modification like this readme.md or other, not necessary to upgrade repository on Render).
